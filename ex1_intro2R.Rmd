## Reading data

Our first exercise entails reading data from files and summarizing and combining the records. This is very common and important step; but somewhat tricky to learn.  We will use the data in a file named "Operating-Health-Facilities-with-location-2014.csv" under "data" read the data in the file into a data.frame and answer all the questions by using R code only. 

Replace the ___________ with the appropriate code 

Feel free to use materials of Introduction to R in: http://rspatial.org/intr/.

1. Read the file into a data.frame.

> d <- read.csv(___________, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

2. how many rows and columns are there?

> _________

3. what are the variable names?

> _________

4. What is the number of facilities for each zone?
See [data exploration](https://rspatial.org/intr/7-explore.html#data-exploration)

> table(_________) 

5. Which region has most facilities (and how many), and which has least (and how many)?

> x <- table(_________)<br> 
> names(which.min(_________)) <br> 
> names(x)[which.min(x)]<br> 
> min(_________)<br> 

6. What is the average elevation of all clinics?

> mean(_________, na.rm=_________)


7. Create a data.frame with four columns: ZONE, REGION, the number of facilities, and their average elevation (by REGION)

> we want something like this

| ZONE      | REGION        | elevation | n   |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----|
| 1 Central | Dodoma        | 1059.4    | 369 |
| 2 Central | Singida       | 1355.4    | 210 |
| 3 Eastern | Dar es Salaam | 54.4      | 599 |

We can use the aggregate function. If you struggle, divide and conquer. Do what you can do first. Split the task into parts, and then combine them again later.

> One approach:
> a1 <- aggregate(_________, d[, c('ZONE', 'REGION')], FUN=_________, na.rm=_________) 
> a2 <- aggregate(d$ALTITUDE, d[, c('ZONE', 'REGION')], FUN=_________)
> a <- merge(_________, _________, by=_________)
 
7b. provide appropriate column names 

> colnames(a)____  <- c('elevation', 'n')

7c. sort by ZONE, REGION. See Introduction to R. Chapter 11

> a <- a[order(_________, _________), ]

7d. elevation should be rounded to the nearest 10 cm

> a$elevation <- _________(_________ , _________)

7e. show the first five lines of the data.frame

> a[_________, ]

7f. Save "a" in a file on your disk (comma separated by values format)

> write._________(_________, _________, row.names=FALSE)

8. Also read fdile "Tanzania-All-Waterpoints-July-2015.csv"

> w <- read.csv(_________, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

9. For each region, compute the total number of water points, and the total number of people served (POPULATION.SERVED),  and the most common quantity ("WATER_QUAN") and type ("WATERPOINT") (either use the "modal" function from the raster package; or  use the table function

>  number of water points:

> wa <- aggregate(w[, _________], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], _________) 
colnames(wa)[2] <- 'nwp'

> number of people served 

> wb <- aggregate(w[, _________, drop=FALSE], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], _________, na.rm=TRUE) 

> modal function from the raster package

> library(raster)
>  wc <- aggregate(w[, _________], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], modal, na.rm=TRUE) 

> or

> f <- function(x) names(which.max(table(x)))
wc <- aggregate(w[, _________], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], f) 

> combine:

> water <- merge(_________, _________, by='REGION')
> water <- merge(water, _________, by='REGION')

10. Make a table that shows counts of water quality types ("WATER_QUAL") by region

> qual <- table(_________, _________)

11. Make a new data.frame that combines the REGION level totals/averages for the  Health facilities and for the water points, and for the water quality
to get something like:

>  m <- merge(a, water, by='REGION')
> q <- as.data.frame.matrix(qual)
>  result <- merge(_________, _________, by.x='REGION', by.y=0)
> head(result)

> or

> m <- merge(a, water, by='REGION')
> qq <- as.data.frame(qual)
> qq <- reshape(, direction='wide', timevar='Var2', idvar='Var1')
> result <- merge(_________, _________, by.x='REGION', by.y=1)
