## Reading data

Our first exercise entails reading data from files and summarizing and combining the records. This is very common and important step; but somewhat tricky to learn.  We will use the data in a file named "Operating-Health-Facilities-with-location-2014.csv" under "data" read the data in the file into a data.frame and answer all the questions by using R code only. 

Replace the ___________ with the appropriate code 

Feel free to use materials of Introduction to R in: http://rspatial.org/intr/.

1. Read the file into a data.frame.
d <- read.csv(___________, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

2. how many rows and columns are there?
_________

3. what are the variable names?
_________

4. What is the number of facilities for each zone?
See [data exploration](https://rspatial.org/intr/7-explore.html#data-exploration)
table(_________) 


5. Which region has most facilities (and how many), and which has least (and how many)?

- x <- table(_________)<br> 
- names(which.min(_________)) <br> 
- names(x)[which.min(x)]<br> 
- min(_________)<br>
