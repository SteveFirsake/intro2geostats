## Geostatistical prediction

in this case, the model parameters are commonly estimated in an objective way, following probability theory. The predictions are accompanied with an estimate of the prediction error. A drawback is that the input data set usually need to satisfy strict statistical assumptions. There are at least four groups of linear statistical models:

  a. kriging (plain geostatistics);
  b. environmental correlation (e.g. regression-based);
  c. Bayesian-based models (e.g. Bayesian Maximum Entropy);
  d. hybrid models (e.g. regression-kriging).
  
In this lesson we cover the first category (non-geostatistical).
