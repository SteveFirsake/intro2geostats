Principle plots like histogram, boxplots and kurtosis can help detect distributions of data that deviates from the normal. In additions maps can aid illustrate any spatial trends.



```{r t1}
d <- read.csv("soil_data_CIAT.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(d, n=3)
```

Examine the spatial trend of pH by using regression on coordinates
```{r t2}
trend <- lm(Clay~X+Y, d) 
summary(trend)

```
