## Background

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce principles of Geostatical data analysis in R.

We will use **gstat** package, because it offers the widest geostatistical functionality in R namely: 

1. variogram cloud diagnostics, 
2. variogram modelling, 
3. simple kriging to local universal cokriging, 
4. multivariate geostatistics, 
5. block kriging, 
6. indicator kriging and, 
7. Gaussian conditional simulation e.t.c

The tutorial is organized into exercises as follows:

1. Exercise 1: [Introduction to R](ex1_intro2R.html).
2. [Answers to exercise](ex1_intro2R_answers.html).
3. Exercise 2:
