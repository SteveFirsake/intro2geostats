Geostatistical analysis involves estimation and modelling of spatial correlation (covariance or semivariance), and evaluating whether simplifying assumptions such as stationarity can be justified or need refinement.


```{r t1}
d <- read.csv("soil_data_CIAT.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(d, n=3)
```

Examine the spatial trend of pH by using regression on coordinates
```{r t2}
trend <- lm(Clay~X+Y, d) 
summary(trend)

```
